# Customer_Segmentation
Customer segmentation is the practice of dividing a customer base into groups with shared characteristics. This allows businesses to target specific groups with tailored marketing campaigns, products, or services. It's like giving different groups of people different flyers at an event - you tailor the message to their interests.
